# Equipment Types Summary

## Expanded Equipment Types in Grouping UI

Your application now supports **23 comprehensive equipment types** with full descriptions for display in the UI:

### HVAC Systems
1. **AHUs (Air Handling Units)** - Equipment that conditions and delivers air via fans.
2. **DOAS (Dedicated Outside Air Systems)** - AHUs that supply air directly to a zone.
3. **VAVs (Variable Air Volume Systems)** - Equipment in air distribution systems.
4. **FCUs (Fan Coil Units)** - Devices with a fan used to condition air.
5. **Heat Pumps** - Equipment employing a vapor compression cycle with a reversing valve for heating or cooling.
6. **VRF (Variable Refrigerant Flow Systems)** - Variable refrigerant flow air conditioning systems.

### Plant Equipment
7. **Boilers** - Equipment used to generate hot water or steam for heating.
8. **Chillers** - Equipment used to remove heat from a liquid.
9. **Cooling Towers** - Equipment used to transfer waste heat into the atmosphere.

### Specialized HVAC
10. **CRACs (Computer Room Air Conditioners)** - Used to cool spaces housing computer and networking gear.
11. **Desiccant Dehumidifiers** - Equipment that decreases air humidity using a substance that absorbs moisture.
12. **Fume Hoods** - Ventilation equipment designed to limit exposure to hazardous fumes.

### Metering & Utilities
13. **Electric Meters** - Representing the measurement of electricity consumption.
14. **Gas Meters** - Representing the measurement of gas consumption.
15. **Water Meters** - Representing the measurement of water consumption.
16. **Steam Meters** - Representing the measurement of steam consumption.

### Power & Distribution
17. **Electric Panels** - Electrical distribution panels, circuits, and protective equipment.
18. **Motors (Fans, Pumps, and Other Motors)** - Motor-driven equipment including fans, pumps, and variable frequency drives.
19. **EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment)** - Equipment that delivers power to an electric vehicle.

### Zones & Spaces
20. **Zones** - Room or space control systems for occupancy, HVAC, air quality, and lighting.
21. **Data Centers** - Data center infrastructure including servers, networking, and environmental controls.

### Advanced Systems
22. **ATES (Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage)** - Aquifer thermal energy storage systems for seasonal energy storage.

## Key Features

✅ **Full Description Display** - Each equipment type now includes a comprehensive description shown in the UI
✅ **Enhanced Pattern Matching** - Improved regex patterns for better equipment detection
✅ **Specialized Point Patterns** - Tailored point patterns for each equipment type
✅ **Better Categorization** - More granular equipment categories (separated boilers, chillers, etc.)
✅ **Project Haystack Compliance** - Aligned with Project Haystack standards and terminology

## Pattern Improvements

- **Separated specialized equipment** (CRACs from general data center equipment)
- **Added specific meter types** (electric, gas, water, steam) 
- **Enhanced detection patterns** for better accuracy
- **Optimized point patterns** for each equipment category

The equipment types are now fully integrated into your grouping UI and will display with their descriptions in the main panel accordion view.
