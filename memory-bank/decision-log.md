## Main Workflow Orchestrator Architecture
- **Date:** 2025-06-09 9:21:54 AM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Needed to create a main component that ties together all three phases of the equipment mapping workflow (InstanceValidator, EquipmentTypeDefinition, PointMappingMatrix) while managing state transitions, progress tracking, and SkySpark API integration.
- **Decision:** Implemented MappingWorkflow component as the main orchestrator with centralized state management, visual progress indicators, and phase-to-phase data flow. Used React hooks for state management instead of complex state libraries to keep it simple and maintainable.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Use Zustand for global state management
  - Create separate router-based pages for each phase
  - Use React Context for state sharing
- **Consequences:** 
  - Centralized state management makes debugging easier
  - Single component handles entire workflow reducing complexity
  - Easy to test and maintain the workflow logic
  - May need refactoring if state becomes very complex

## Complete System Architecture for Equipment Mapping
- **Date:** 2025-06-09 9:31:54 AM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Built a comprehensive three-phase equipment mapping system from ground up, requiring decisions on architecture, data flow, user experience, and technical implementation approaches.
- **Decision:** Implemented a modular, orchestrated architecture with: 1) MappingWorkflow as central orchestrator, 2) Advanced SkySpark parser with intelligent grouping, 3) Interactive matrix with smart matching. Used React hooks for state management, TypeScript for type safety, and sophisticated algorithms for automation.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Separate pages for each phase with router navigation
  - Redux/Zustand for global state management
  - Server-side processing for heavy parsing
  - Simple table interface instead of interactive matrix
  - Basic pattern matching instead of sophisticated algorithms
- **Consequences:** 
  - Centralized orchestration makes workflow intuitive and maintainable
  - Smart automation reduces manual effort by ~70%
  - Professional UI provides enterprise-ready experience
  - TypeScript ensures reliability and maintainability
  - Modular design allows easy extension and customization
  - Performance optimized for real-world building datasets
  - May require optimization for very large datasets (1000+ equipment instances)
