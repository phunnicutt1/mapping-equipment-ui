The user interface for mapping building automation equipment was developed over the course of our conversation.

Initially, the user reported a 400 Bad Request error when uploading trio files. The investigation revealed a mismatch between the client and server FormData expectations. The client-side `lib/store.ts` was sending files with the key `'files'`, while the server at `app/api/upload/route.ts` expected indexed keys like `'file_0', 'file_1'`. The issue was resolved by modifying the `uploadFiles` function in `lib/store.ts` to use indexed field names.

Following this fix, the user initiated a major feature request, managed via the Shrimp Task Manager. The core requirements were:
1.  Display rich template cards (from the Template Manager modal) in a horizontally scrolling row on the main equipment panel.
2.  Fix the "Save Template" functionality.
3.  Implement a reliable auto-assignment workflow where templates are automatically applied to suggested equipment with matching point signatures, moving them to the "Confirmed" pool.

The first implementation attempt went awry when the assistant incorrectly identified a simple `EquipmentTypeCard` as the target template card, leading to incorrect refactoring. The user provided feedback and a screenshot for clarification, prompting a restart of the process.

The second, correct implementation involved:
1.  **Component Extraction:** The correct, detailed template card logic was identified in `components/TemplateManager.tsx` and extracted into a new, reusable component: `components/mapping/RichTemplateCard.tsx`.
2.  **UI Integration:** This new `RichTemplateCard` was integrated into `components/MainPanel.tsx` inside a horizontally scrolling container. This step encountered several tooling issues where `edit_file` broke the JSX structure of `MainPanel.tsx`, which was ultimately resolved by rewriting the entire file's content to ensure correctness.
3.  **Build Fix:** A subsequent build failed because the first incorrect implementation had left a zombie import for a deleted `TemplateCard` in `components/mapping/EquipmentTypeDefinition.tsx`. This was fixed by removing the import and restoring the component's original code.

With the visual component in place, the user provided further detailed requirements for its functionality, which were broken down into a new set of tasks:
1.  **Add an "Inspect Points" button** to the template card.
2.  **Add a "Delete" button** that releases any associated equipment from the "Confirmed" pool back to "Suggested".
3.  **Implement the auto-assignment logic** in the store.

This was executed systematically:
1.  **Modal Creation:** A new `InspectTemplateModal.tsx` was created, and the necessary state (`templateToInspect`) and action (`inspectTemplatePoints`) were added to `lib/store.ts`.
2.  **Button Updates:** Based on user feedback, the existing "Favorite" button on the `RichTemplateCard` was repurposed to be the "Inspect" button (changing its icon and function), and a new "Delete" button was added.
3.  **Core Logic Implementation:** The `lib/store.ts` file was updated with two key functions:
    *   `deleteTemplate(templateId)`: Reverts the status of associated equipment to `'suggested'` and removes the template.
    *   `runTemplateAutoAssignment()`: Compares point signatures between active templates and suggested equipment, automatically confirming any matches. This function was hooked to run after data is processed in the `setProcessedData` action.
4.  **Final Integration:** The UI was connected to the new store logic. The "Inspect" button was wired to open the modal, and the "Delete" button was connected to the `deleteTemplate` action, wrapped in a `window.confirm` dialog for safety. This was done for the cards in both `MainPanel.tsx` and `TemplateManager.tsx` for consistency.

The conversation concluded after the user adjusted the assistant's tooling, which was then successfully verified with a write-read-delete test cycle on a temporary file. All planned tasks for the feature were marked as complete.
