## Update History

- [2025-06-10 4:41:46 AM] [Unknown User] - Fixed Equipment Panel Border Colors: Successfully resolved the equipment panel border color issue. The problem was Tailwind CSS not recognizing dynamically generated border color classes. Fixed by adding a comprehensive safelist to tailwind.config.js containing all possible border-l-* color variations, simplified the border color logic in MainPanel with better debugging, and confirmed colors now properly match between equipment type badges and equipment panel left borders. Equipment panels now display the correct colored vertical line matching their equipment type color from the top stats panel.
- [2025-06-10 4:37:51 AM] [Unknown User] - Enhanced Equipment Type Color System with Initial + Template Types: Successfully enhanced the color system to handle both initial auto-detected equipment types and user-created templates: Added color field to EquipmentType interface, updated processEquipmentGrouping to assign random colors to initial equipment types (AHU, VAV, FCU, etc.), modified TopStatsPanel to display both initial equipment types AND templates with their respective colors in single-line layout, updated MainPanel to show color-coded border indicators for both initial equipment types and templates. System now shows initial equipment types on first load with colors, then adds template-based equipment types as users create them during mapping. Files: lib/types.ts, lib/utils.ts, components/TopStatsPanel.tsx, components/MainPanel.tsx. Result: Complete dual equipment type system with consistent color coding across all interfaces.
- [2025-06-10 4:32:54 AM] [Unknown User] - Implemented Template-Based Equipment Type Colors: Successfully implemented dynamic color-coded equipment types based on user-created templates: Added color field to EquipmentTemplate interface, created generateRandomTemplateColor() function with 28 vibrant colors, updated createTemplate() to assign random colors, modified TopStatsPanel to show template distribution with assigned colors, added color-coded left border indicators to equipment panels in MainPanel using template colors. Templates now serve as equipment types with unique visual identifiers. Files: lib/types.ts, lib/utils.ts, lib/store.ts, components/TopStatsPanel.tsx, components/MainPanel.tsx. Result: Each template gets a unique color that appears in equipment type stats and as visual indicators on equipment panels.
- [2025-06-10 4:25:10 AM] [Unknown User] - Fixed PointPropertiesTags Component: Restored PointPropertiesTags component from main branch to fix import errors and restore tag functionality. Component now properly displays colored tags for BACnet markers (point, cmd, cur, his, writable, bacnetPoint) in both MainPanel and ConfirmedEquipmentDrawer. Tags are color-coded with tooltips and follow Project Haystack standards. This fixes the visual tag system that shows point properties at the bottom of equipment panels.
- [2025-06-10 4:10:41 AM] [Unknown User] - Updated Confirmed Equipment Interface: Successfully implemented confirmed equipment drawer improvements: Added green square display to LeftRail from main branch (without button), restructured ConfirmedEquipmentDrawer to match UnassignedPointsDrawer structure opening from LEFT side, added search/filter functionality, integrated PointPropertiesTags for consistency, preserved existing MainPanel button and core mapping workflows. Modified files: lib/store.ts, components/LeftRail.tsx, components/ConfirmedEquipmentDrawer.tsx. Result: Professional confirmed equipment interface matching UnassignedPointsDrawer UX.
