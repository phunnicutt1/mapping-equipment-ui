## Update History

- [2025-06-10 2:08:45 AM] [Unknown User] - Tripled equipment panel spacing: Increased spacing from ml-6 to ml-18 (tripled from 24px to 72px) to position manufacturer/model labels much further toward the center of the equipment panel for better visual balance
- [2025-06-10 2:07:25 AM] [Unknown User] - Added spacing to equipment panel layout: Increased margin from ml-2 to ml-6 after points count badge to position manufacturer/model labels more toward the center of the panel with better visual balance
- [2025-06-10 2:03:44 AM] [Unknown User] - Reorganized equipment panel layout: Moved confidence label to underneath action buttons on right side and moved location label to be inline with manufacturer/model on left side, creating better space utilization and visual hierarchy
- [2025-06-10 1:57:41 AM] [Unknown User] - Enhanced equipment container styling: Improved equipment container visual separation with border/shadow styling and reorganized manufacturer/model labels to be inline with confidence badges, optimizing the use of empty space while maintaining location labels in their logical position
- [2025-06-10 1:45:53 AM] [Unknown User] - Streamlined point record layout: Made layout optimizations: 1) Removed Display Name from grid since it's already shown as the bold title, 2) Moved Device Location from under Description to the 3rd column (where Display Name was), preventing content crowding, 3) Made Source File inline by putting label and value on same line with a colon separator instead of stacked. This creates a cleaner, more efficient use of space.
- [2025-06-10 1:41:45 AM] [Unknown User] - Final layout refinements for point records: Made final adjustments to point record layout: 1) Made title bold (font-bold), 2) Unified bottom line so Properties (left) and Source File + Data Type (right) are aligned on same horizontal line using flex justify-between, 3) Moved Device Location to appear directly under Description instead of in the grid. This creates a cleaner, more organized layout with better visual hierarchy.
- [2025-06-10 1:38:06 AM] [Unknown User] - Reorganized point record layout: Restructured the point detail container layout: 1) Moved Device Location to replace Source File in the main grid, 2) Moved Properties tags to the bottom left corner with absolute positioning, 3) Moved Source File to bottom right corner alongside the data type badge. This creates a cleaner grid layout with important metadata positioned in the corners for better visual hierarchy.
- [2025-06-10 1:34:08 AM] [Unknown User] - Moved data type badge to bottom right corner: Relocated the data type badge (e.g. 'Number') from its position under the title to the bottom right corner of the point detail container. Added relative positioning to the container and absolute positioning to the badge for precise placement. This creates a cleaner header layout while keeping the data type information visible.
- [2025-06-10 1:30:32 AM] [Unknown User] - Applied exact font styling from developer tools: Updated all point record typography to match the exact styling shown in the browser developer tools. Applied Segoe UI font family, exact colors (#7f8c8d for labels, #2c3e50 for values), font-weight 500, and proper sizing (text-xs for labels). Added custom Tailwind configuration for detail colors and font family. The styling now precisely matches the reference implementation.
- [2025-06-10 1:24:47 AM] [Unknown User] - Updated typography for point record fields: Enhanced the font styling for point record details to match the clean, readable appearance. Updated field values from text-sm to text-base with font-medium for better readability. Point title increased to text-xl font-medium. Field labels remain text-sm for good hierarchy. Also renamed "Source" to "Source File" for clarity.
- [2025-06-10 1:19:21 AM] [Unknown User] - Refined PointPropertiesTags to strictly filter markers: Updated the component to strictly filter and display ONLY the 6 allowed BACnet markers (bacnetPoint, cmd, cur, his, point, writable). Now extracts markers more selectively, handles SkySpark 'M' marker format, and completely filters out all other markers instead of showing them as invalid tags. This ensures clean display with only the legitimate Project Haystack point markers.
- [2025-06-10 1:14:31 AM] [Unknown User] - Successfully completed point properties tag implementation: âœ… Completed implementation of PointPropertiesTags component that displays BACnet marker properties as visual tags instead of comma-separated text. Component follows Project Haystack standards, validates 6 allowed markers (bacnetPoint, cmd, cur, his, point, writable), includes tooltips with descriptions, and has been integrated into both MainPanel and UnassignedPointsDrawer components. Implementation includes proper tag styling, validation logic, and graceful handling of different point data structures.
- [2025-06-10 1:13:04 AM] [Unknown User] - Implemented PointPropertiesTags component: Created custom React component with visual tags for BACnet marker properties. Updated MainPanel and UnassignedPointsDrawer to use tag-based display instead of comma-separated text. Component supports 6 allowed markers: bacnetPoint, cmd, cur, his, point, writable with Project Haystack validation.
- [2025-06-10 1:11:25 AM] [Unknown User] - Decision Made: Properties Display Implementation Strategy
- [2025-06-10 1:10:44 AM] [Unknown User] - Started point properties tag implementation: Initializing memory bank and exploring codebase to implement Tagify-based tags for BACnet marker properties instead of comma-separated list display. Target tags: bacnetPoint, cmd, cur, his, point, writable
