## Celebration Animation Implementation Strategy
- **Date:** 2025-06-10 5:08:46 AM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** User requested a confetti celebration animation when all equipment mapping is completed (100% assignment), with automatic saving functionality.
- **Decision:** Implemented a comprehensive celebration system using Framer Motion with confetti physics simulation, automatic completion detection, and integrated auto-save functionality.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Simple modal with success message
  - Toast notification only
  - Redirect to completion page
  - Static celebration screen
- **Consequences:** 
  - Enhanced user experience with satisfying completion feedback
  - Automatic data preservation on completion
  - Increased bundle size due to Framer Motion
  - Physics simulation may impact performance on slower devices
  - Creates memorable and engaging completion experience

## Replaced Polling with Event-Driven Celebration Triggers
- **Date:** 2025-06-10 5:28:57 AM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** User correctly identified that checking every 5 seconds was overkill and suggested tying celebration to the actual event that makes the equipment panel disappear.
- **Decision:** Implemented intelligent panel-based detection using React useEffect that triggers when the equipment panel becomes empty (all equipment confirmed), replacing inefficient polling with event-driven architecture.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Continue with 5-second polling
  - Use state change listeners on equipment status
  - Manual trigger only
  - Completion detection on specific user actions only
- **Consequences:** 
  - Significant performance improvement by eliminating polling
  - Natural trigger aligned with user experience
  - More reliable detection of actual completion state
  - Better debugging capabilities with detailed logging
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code architecture
