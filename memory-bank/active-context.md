# Current Context

## Ongoing Tasks

- Implement the researched methodology for automated BACnet point grouping and equipment classification.
- Develop a feature engineering pipeline to create equipment 'signatures' from raw point data using Project Haystack tags.
- Implement K-Modes clustering to automatically classify equipment into types.
- Generate equipment templates from cluster modes.
- Calculate confidence scores for classifications and detect anomalies for new template suggestions.
## Known Issues

- Ensuring the Haystack tag dictionary is comprehensive for the provided data.
- Fine-tuning the K-Modes algorithm and the optimal number of clusters (k).
- Defining a reliable dissimilarity threshold for anomaly detection.
## Next Steps

- Implement the data parsers for `.trio` and connector files.
- Develop the Haystack tag dictionary and the point-to-tag mapping logic.
- Integrate the K-Modes clustering pipeline using the `kmodes` library.
- Develop the confidence scoring mechanism using the Silhouette Score.
- Implement the human-in-the-loop validation and proactive auto-assignment workflow.
## Current Session Notes

- [6:32:01 AM] [Unknown User] Created upload API endpoint: Created /api/upload/route.ts that handles file uploads for trio and CSV files. The endpoint processes multiple files, parses trio format using existing trio-parser, handles CSV connector data, and enhances points with connector information. Includes proper error handling and logging.
- [6:31:30 AM] [Unknown User] Added file upload component: Created FileUpload.tsx component that provides UI for uploading trio and CSV files. Integrated into LeftRail above the Grouping Method section as requested. Component includes file selection, upload progress, and error handling.
