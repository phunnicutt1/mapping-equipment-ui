## Update History

- [2025-06-09 10:48:17 AM] [Unknown User] - Implemented equipment template system with auto-mapping: Successfully implemented a powerful template system that revolutionizes equipment point confirmation workflow:

## **Core Template Functionality**

1. **Template Creation**:
   - Added "Save as Template" button next to "Confirm All Points" in equipment panels
   - Button only appears when equipment has confirmed points (purple styling for distinction)
   - Creates point signature from confirmed points including navName, kind, unit, BACnet type, and properties
   - Prompts user for custom template name with sensible defaults

2. **Automatic Template Application**:
   - Scans for similar equipment of same type without existing templates
   - Matches equipment with 70%+ point signature compatibility  
   - Auto-confirms matching points and equipment instances
   - Updates equipment with template reference for tracking

## **Enhanced Data Structures**

3. **New Type Interfaces**:
   - `EquipmentTemplate`: Core template with point signatures and metadata
   - `PointSignature`: Detailed point matching criteria (navName, kind, unit, BACnet type, properties)
   - `templateId` field on equipment instances for template tracking
   - Template statistics in ProcessingStats

4. **Store Actions**:
   - `createTemplate()`: Creates template and triggers auto-application
   - `applyTemplateToSimilarEquipment()`: Background automation logic
   - Template persistence in saveDraft/finalize operations

## **User Experience Flow**

5. **Workflow Automation**:
   - User confirms points on first equipment instance
   - Clicks "Save as Template" to create reusable pattern
   - System automatically finds and processes similar equipment in background
   - User gets immediate feedback on how many equipment instances were auto-processed
   - Massive time savings on repetitive confirmation tasks

## **UI Enhancements**

6. **Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Added "Templated" counter to top stats panel (5-column layout)
   - Template summary showing count and auto-application statistics
   - Visual feedback on automation impact

## **Technical Implementation**

7. **Smart Matching Algorithm**:
   - Point signature matching based on multiple criteria
   - 70% threshold for automatic application (configurable)
   - Preserves user control while maximizing automation
   - Prevents over-application to dissimilar equipment

This feature transforms the user experience from manual point-by-point confirmation to template-driven automation, potentially reducing mapping time by 80%+ for similar equipment types.
