      "analysisResult": "System consolidation and integration task to unify existing advanced ML pipeline (K-Modes clustering, Project Haystack tagging, Python backend) with frontend workflow. Current system has dual implementation - legacy regex-based and advanced ML-based. Goal is to deprecate legacy system and make ML pipeline the primary data processing workflow while maintaining existing UI/UX patterns.",
      "summary": "Task 8 (Performance Monitoring and Analytics) has been successfully completed with comprehensive implementation and critical browser compatibility fix. \n\n**Key Achievements:**\n✅ **Browser Compatibility Resolved**: Successfully migrated server-side Python integration functions from client-side code to API routes (/api/performance-analytics, /api/quality-alerts, /api/export-analytics, /api/reset-analytics, /api/python-health)\n✅ **Performance Dashboard**: Fully functional with real-time analytics, health scoring, quality alerts, and export functionality\n✅ **ML Pipeline Integration**: Complete monitoring of clustering quality, user interactions, tag generation, and Python service health\n✅ **API Architecture**: Clean separation of server-side Node.js operations from browser-safe client code\n✅ **Production Ready**: TypeScript build successful, all compatibility issues resolved\n✅ **Comprehensive Analytics**: User interaction tracking, clustering metrics, A/B testing framework, data export capabilities\n\n**Technical Resolution:**\n- Fixed child_process browser compatibility by creating dedicated API routes\n- Resolved all TypeScript signature mismatches and import issues\n- Eliminated duplicate properties in haystack dictionary\n- Maintained full functionality while ensuring browser safety\n\nThe performance monitoring system is now fully operational and integrated with the complete ML pipeline, providing enterprise-grade analytics and monitoring capabilities for the BACnet equipment grouping system.",
